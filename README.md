Beat Saber mod for displaying nya-tastic images from various anime themed web APIs
## Usage
Nya's settings can be accessed from either the Mod Settings panel or from within Nya's setting modal
### Supported Image Sources
**Note: I don't own any of these sources so I can't guarantee the images will always be appropiate**
* [Waifu.Pics](https://waifu.pics/)
* [Nekos.Life](https://nekos.life/)
* [xSky API](https://api.xsky.dev/)
* [Anime-Images API](https://anime-api.hisoka17.repl.co/)
* [Local Files](#local-files)
### Local Files
In order for local files to work there must be compatible images in the sfw / nsfw files found in Nya's UserData folder.
The compatible file types are PNG, JPEG, GIF and APNG.
Images which are downloaded via Nya will also be placed in the sfw / nsfw folders.
