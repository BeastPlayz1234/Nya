# Nya
Beat Saber mod for displaying nya-tastic images from various anime themed web APIs
## Installation
Download the latest version of Nya from [releases](https://github.com/Sirspam/Nya/releases) and slap it into your BeatSaber's plugin folder.

Nya requires BSML and SiraUtil, which can both be found in ModAssistant.
## Supported web APIs
* [Waifu.Pics](https://waifu.pics/)
* [Nekos.Life](https://nekos.life/)

## Contribution
This is my first Beat Saber mod and experience with C# programming so I wouldn't be surprised if there's better code architecture or methods which could be implemented.

Feel free to point out any suggestions or improvements to me by submitting a PR or contacting me on discord (Sirspam#7765).
