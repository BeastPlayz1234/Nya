# Nya
BeatSaber mod for displaying images from the nekos.life API

I don't want to grind for PP anymore, I just want to browse nekos.
## Installation
Download the latest version of Nya from [releases]() and slap it into your BeatSaber's plugin folder.

Nya requires BSML and SiraUtil, which can both be found in ModAssistant.
## Contribution
This is my first BS mod and program with C# so I wouldn't be surprised if there's better code architecture or methods which I could've implemented.

Feel free to point out any improvements to me by submitting a PR or contacting me on discord (Sirspam#7765).
