# Nya

Beat Saber mod for displaying nya-tastic images from various anime themed web APIs

## Installation

Download the latest version of Nya from [releases](https://github.com/Sirspam/Nya/releases) and slap it into your BeatSaber's plugin folder.

Nya requires BSML and SiraUtil, which can both be found in ModAssistant.

## Supported web APIs

* [Waifu.Pics](https://waifu.pics/)
* [Nekos.Life](https://nekos.life/)
* Local Files *(Not really a web API but I may as well list it)*

### Local Files

## Contribution

This is my first Beat Saber mod and experience with C# programming so I wouldn't be surprised if there's better methods or what not which could be implemented.

Feel free to point out any suggestions or improvements to me by submitting a PR or contacting me on discord ([Sirspam#7765](https://discordapp.com/users/232574143818760192)).
